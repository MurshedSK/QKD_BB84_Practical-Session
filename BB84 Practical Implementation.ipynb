    "* **Practice (Eavesdropping):** The experimental eavesdropping section (Q2.7) was replaced with a Cirq simulation. The simulation (results attached) produced a **16.67% QBER**. This non-zero result confirms that Eve's presence introduces detectable errors, validating the security principle of the protocol.\n",
